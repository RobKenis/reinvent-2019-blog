Re:Invent is the time of the year where new things see the light, where things change. But some things never change, no matter how hard you try. You've given it all, swiched things around, but you still don't see any improvements. I am ofcourse talking about Rob's tolerance for alcohol.

## Re:Invent pubcrawl
Here's where it all started, the pubcrawl. Free entrance, free beer, brought to you by AWS. The atmosphere was friendly, like all the attending developers and the beer was chill like a hot summer's day. I hear you thinking: "Beer, in America?". Yes, most bars have Stella so even Americans don't have to deal with Budweiser. So the beer was flowing and we drank a couple. Because of this, things kicked off very quickly with some Ukrainian dude. And before we knew, we we surrounded a Ukrainian, and American and someone from Poland. This sounds like the start of a terrible joke, but I'm scared to make jokes in the presence of Americans. So after we had a laugh, made fun of the Germans and discussed operating systems, I use Arch btw, we got to the topic of our daily jobs. And that's where it all escalated. The American was a big fan op php. I couldn't believe what I had just witnessed, the trust he had built in the past hour, all gone. So after some more beer, we notices they were a lost cause and went our seperate ways.

## Benelux Drinks
Our way led us to the Benelux drinks. It is exactly what it sounds like, a bunch of Dutch and Belgian people drinking all sorts of good and terrible beer while joking about the Germans and php. We got in, got ourselves a beer, and started a conversation with the introvert on the other side of the room. He was Chilean, of all the people we could've talked to, we picked the South American. It was good fun though, we introduced him to Drum&Bass, Andre Hazes and Clouseau, the 3 most important things the Benelux has to offer. After that, we socialized with the wonderful folks of Cloudar, who also do things with computers. We had a couple more beers and went home.
